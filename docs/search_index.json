This assignment will be primarily about demonstrating some expertice in using RMarkdown, since we will be using Rmds as the primary form of homework and assignments. With that in mind, your assignment for this homework is to: Fork the example repository into your personal GitHub Create an RStudio project from your Personal clone of the Repo. Create a table of contents that is floating, but displays three levels of headers instead of two (by editing the content at the beginning of the document) Make a version of the dygraph with points and lines by using rstudio’s dygraph guide Writing a paragraph on the Poudre river with at least three hyperlinks, two bolded sections, and one italicized phrase. The content of this paragraph is not vital, but try to at least make it true and interesting, and, of course, don’t plagiarize. Knit that document, and then git commit and push to your personal GitHub. Use the GitHub -&gt; Settings -&gt; Pages tab to create a website of your report. Bonus, make the timestamp in the header dynamic. As in it only adds todays date, not just a static date you enter. Bonus, create an “index_talk.Rmd” version of your document using the revealjs package. Add link to your original report-style document. 2.3 DyGraph example. dygraph(q_xts) %&gt;% dyAxis(&quot;y&quot;, label = &quot;Discharge (cfs)&quot;)%&gt;% dyOptions(drawPoint=T, pointSize = 2) 2.4 Poudre Paragraph The Cache la Poudre River is a Colorado river that has headwaters in Rocky Mountain National park and flows 126 miles then into the South Platte River.
